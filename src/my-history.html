      <!-- AM: For small application I believe it's fine to access application state directly 
           AM: from state-aware elements. For more complex application I would pass 
           AM: major data to an element as input, or have state-path set. 
           AM: Accessing state.* is fine for small pieces of data that element might need
           AM: to be aware of, and which you don't want to pass from top level all the way down.
           AM: No need to change here though, perfectly fine for a sample app...
